# Music-AI-V1
This AI creates music based of an existing dataset (This will not be used commercially)

## Python files

To train the model launch either `MusicGeneratorAI.py` or `MusicGeneratorAI2.py` they are both technically the same but from memory `MusicGeneratorAI2.py`is slightlyBetter.

## Training the model requirements.

I haven't tried training it with a graphics card on my main pc but on my laptop and school computer I was able to train it in about an hour for good results.
- I suggest training it on a PC with a graphics card if you do not wish to wait
